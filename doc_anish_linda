1. Importing libraries we may need:

pandas for manipulating and analysis
numpy for large, multi-dimensional arrays 
matplotlib for plotting 
seaborn for visualization 

2. Loading the Data from the Excel Sheet

Giving the code the specific sheet names (Data, DEF, MID, OFF)
dfs = [] empty list to hold Data Frames
df = pd.read_excel("Data.xlsx", sheet_name=sheet_name) reads each sheet into Data Frame

Then we append it into our empty list 

3. Cleaning the Data 

data = data.loc[:, ~data.columns.str.contains('^Unnamed')] 
Selects the rows that are not unnamed 

4. Dropping column
We renamed the column Name.1 Which python automatically named because we had
two columns with the name 'Name'. We thought the that it was a problem 
because that column had a lot of missing values. 
Renaming didnt fix the problem so we decided to drop the column entirely, since it was 
not really important overall 

5. Checking for missing values
data.isnull() using boolean values to find out if the element is missing 
the .sum() makes the sum of all the missing values for each column 


6. Filling missing values numeric 
data.select_dtypes(include=np.number).columns Selects only columns with numeric data 
data[numeric_cols].fillna(data[numeric_cols].mean()) Fills the mean of each column into the missing values 

7. Filling missing values categorical 
for col in categorical_cols:
    mode_value = data[col].mode()[0]
    data[col] = data[col].fillna(mode_value) fill the missing values and assign it back to the DataFrame column.

8. Check if values have been filled

9. summary statistics 
data[numeric_cols].describe(): Generates summary statistics of numeric columns
